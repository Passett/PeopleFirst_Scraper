# PeopleFirst_Scraper
This program scrapes PeopleFirst for jobs in Tallahassee that pay over 60k. It uses Beautiful Soup and regex to find positions that pay over 60k. It accounts for positions that are posted with annual salaries, monthly salaries, hourly salaries, etc. and puts the results in an excel file on my desktop. The Excel file includes the position titles, salaries, and links to the postings for all Tallahassee jobs that paid atleast 60k. 

I used this anytime I wanted to look at possible state job opportunities. I built it because PeopleFirst doesn't provide a filter for salary, so without a scraper it is very time consuming to comb through everything. I actually found my current job by using this script. Something that stands out now is my complete lack of notes. I now make it a habit to add notes as I go.
